# SkillBridge Platform

## Overview

SkillBridge is a mini-application designed to facilitate skill exchange among users. The platform enables individuals to offer their own skills and request services or skills they need in return. It's a practical way to build community, exchange expertise, and meet like-minded people.

**This project is being built as part of the Odoo Hackathon.**
